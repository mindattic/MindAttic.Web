# ====================================================================
# MindAttic.UiUx -> all splice-in-place subscribers (local dev delivery)
# Runs every downstream sync script in sync/ that matches sync-*.ps1
# (except this file). Discovery is glob-based, so the subscriber set is
# whatever is wired up in sync/*.ps1 and subscribers.json. Currently:
#   - sync-mindattic-com.ps1   → mindattic.com/index.htm (inline)
#   - sync-mindattic-psst.ps1  → MindAttic.Psst/{terms,privacy}.htm
#   - sync-streetsamurai.ps1   → StreetSamurai.Blazor/wwwroot/
#
# Catalog landing pages and the Claudia/ChiMesh long-form HTML builds are
# rendered by MindAttic.Deploy (D:/Projects/MindAttic/MindAttic.Deploy);
# they pull components from the jsDelivr CDN at runtime and have no sync
# script here.
#
# Production delivery happens via .github/workflows/sync-subscribers.yml
# (push-triggered cross-repo PRs). This script is the local equivalent
# for fast iteration without round-tripping through GitHub; it is also
# invoked piecewise by MindAttic.Deploy as a preDeploy hook for the
# mindattic.com and StreetSamurai builds.
#
# Idempotent. Safe to re-run after any edit under Components/ or
# Themes/, or to subscribers.json.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -File sync-all.ps1
