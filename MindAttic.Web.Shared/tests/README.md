# MindAttic.UiUx — test suite

End-to-end tests that prove two things:

1. **The package is complete and sound** — `MindAttic.UiUx` contains every file the sites need, laid out per
   [`docs/ASSETS.md`](../docs/ASSETS.md), well-formed (fonts decode, images decode, nothing downscaled or re-encoded) and
   described exactly by `assets-manifest.json`.
2. **The three sites pull their data properly** — `mindattic.com`, `ryandebraal.com` and `mindatticcares.com` load with
   no failed requests or console errors, talk only to allowed hosts, pin the expected release tag, fetch only what they
   need (lazily, from the CDN), and keep their layout correct at every viewport.

Framework: **[Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro)**. It intercepts and asserts on network requests natively,
runs real Chrome across a viewport matrix, and records traces for failures. No browser download is needed — it drives the
Google Chrome that is already installed (`channel: 'chrome'`).

## Install

```powershell
cd MindAttic.UiUx\tests
npm ci                       # installs @playwright/test + cross-env (see package-lock.json)
```

No Chrome? `set PW_CHANNEL=chromium` and run `npx playwright install chromium` once (or `PW_CHANNEL=msedge`).
Optional: `pip install fonttools brotli` enables the deep font check (the structural WOFF2 check always runs).

## Run

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm test` / `npm run test:local` | Everything, **local mode** (default). Sites come from the sibling repos; every `cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mindattic/MindAttic.UiUx@<tag>/**` request is answered from *this working tree*, so it passes before a tag exists and fails loudly if a referenced file is missing. No other network. |
| `npm run test:live` | Everything against the **real sites and real CDN** (no interception). |
| `npm run test:assets` | Package tests only (no browser, ~2 s). |
| `npm run test:sites` | Site tests only (needs Chrome, ~20 s). |
| `npm run test:cdn` | Live CDN verification only (forces live mode). |
| `npm run baseline:update` | Re-record `baselines.json` after you **deliberately** add/replace an image (see below). |
| `npm run report` | Open the last HTML report (CI runs produce one). |

Environment variables:

- `TEST_MODE=live` — test the real sites and the real CDN instead of local copies.
- `UIUX_TAG=V8` — the tag every site must pin. Default: the highest whole-number `V<n>` tag in this repo (the same
  rule the linked deploy uses), so it follows each release automatically; falls back to `V7` only when the tags are
  not available (a shallow CI checkout — use `fetch-depth: 0`).
- `SITES_ROOT=<dir>` — where the sibling site repos live (default: the parent of this repo). Point it at a folder
  of older page copies to prove a check catches a regression.
- `PW_CHANNEL` — `chrome` (default), `msedge` or `chromium`.
- `PW_OUTPUT_DIR=<dir>` — where traces/screenshots go (default `test-results/`). Playwright empties this folder at
  the start of a run, so give concurrent runs different folders.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — only raises the GitHub API rate limit for the tag test.

Chrome runs headless **with classic scrollbars** (`--hide-scrollbars` is removed in `playwright.config.mjs`), so
layout checks see the ~15-17px a desktop scrollbar takes — the overflow a Windows visitor would actually get.

Failures keep a Playwright trace: `npx playwright show-trace test-results/<test>/trace.zip`.

## What each group guards

### `specs/assets/` — the package (no browser)

| Spec | Guards |
|---|---|
| `layout.spec` | Every file the sites rely on exists (fonts, Cyberspace engine + textures, SacredGeometry, each site's logos/images/themes); each font family keeps its TTF source; **no `assets/` level** under a domain folder; domain folders are split into category folders; no junk files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`, leftover `_test.htm`). |
| `manifest.spec` | `assets-manifest.json` exists, is well formed, lists *exactly* the files on disk, and every size + SHA-256 matches; no duplicate files (MAU-LAW-5). |
| `naming.spec` | Lowercase kebab-case names, no spaces/`+`/`_`, zero-padded gap-free series (`sunset-01…20`). |
| `fonts.spec` | Every woff2 is structurally valid (signature, declared length, table directory, Brotli stream decodes to the promised size) — a corrupt woff2 makes browsers *silently* fall back to a system font, which is exactly how the old embedded Outfit-latin bug hid. TTF sources are valid sfnt. Deep check (when Python + fontTools exist): decodes, correct family, glyph count. |
| `images.spec` | Every PNG/JPEG/ICO/GIF decodes (CRCs, no truncation); Cyberspace textures are 1080×1920 PNGs; **nothing was downscaled** (dimensions ≥ baseline); **lossy files are byte-identical to their baseline** (never re-encoded). |
| `budgets.spec` | Per-type size ceilings and per-folder totals (`lib/budgets.mjs`). |

### `specs/sites/` — the three sites (browser)

`common.spec` runs for every site: well-formed page; **no failed / non-2xx requests, no console errors, no uncaught
exceptions**; requests only to the site's origin + the allow-list (`lib/paths.mjs → SITES[*].allowedHosts`); pins exactly the
expected `@V<n>` tag (never `@main`, no stale tag); every UiUx URL in the HTML exists in the package and every asset is in
the manifest; `<link rel=preconnect>` to jsDelivr; HTML size budget and no oversized `data:` URIs (guards against
re-embedding base64); fonts actually load from the CDN (Outfit latin / Attic; latin-ext stays unfetched unless needed); no
horizontal scrollbar from 320 to 1920 px; comments make no "one file / no external requests" claims.

Site-specific:

* **`mindattic.spec`** — at ten viewports (320×568 … 3440×1440, 1920×300, 400×1920, 120×600): three equal-width buttons whose
  combined width equals the wordmark width (±0.5 px), lockup fully on-screen and centered (±1 px), no scrollbars, footer
  fixed to the bottom; fonts/colours (Attic wordmark, Outfit buttons, white text at rest and hover); links have the right
  `href`/`target`/`rel`; engine scripts are `defer`red, textures + fonts preloaded; the engine exposes every effect the tap
  handler uses; **tap-anywhere spawns an effect** (≥ 12 of 15 taps, auto-spawner off), tapping a link spawns nothing and opens
  the right site in a new window (external navigations are stubbed, so the test never leaves the sandbox).
* **`ryandebraal.spec`** — no base64 JPEG/PNG/WOFF2 payloads left; every image of the sunset/sakura series exists in the
  package + manifest; first paint requests *only* the Outfit latin font and the avatar; switching to the sakura / sunset / noir
  themes fetches that theme's artwork from the CDN with 200; the avatar lightbox opens and lazily loads the portrait; PDF
  export loads `html2pdf` on demand (stubbed in local mode, real in live mode).
* **`mindatticcares.spec`** — every `<img>` has `width`/`height`/`alt`, below-the-fold art is `loading=lazy`; first paint
  loads only the Home art; navigating to *Child's Play* / *Y2K* fetches that page's art on demand; deep links (`#y2k`,
  `#sec-budget`) work; the YouTube player is click-to-play (no third-party request before the click).

### `specs/cdn/` — live CDN (live mode only)

For every site, parses the tag it pins from the **live** HTML and checks that each referenced file is served by jsDelivr with
HTTP 200, the right `content-type`, `access-control-allow-origin: *`, a year-long/immutable `cache-control`, and **bytes +
SHA-256 identical to `assets-manifest.json`**. Also: tags are whole-number and contiguous (`V1…Vn`, via the GitHub API) and
the expected tag is published. Expect these to fail until the tag is pushed **and** the sites are deployed — that is the point.

### `pester/` — `build.ps1` (PowerShell, no browser)

`build.Tests.ps1` runs the standalone vendoring build into a temp folder and checks that a component or theme is copied
byte-for-byte (subfolders included), reruns are identical, an ambiguous name (`Cyberspace`) needs `-Kind`, an unknown name
lists what exists, and no `Ideas/` folder is needed. Run from the repo root: `Invoke-Pester -Path tests/pester` (Pester 5+).

## Known issue encoded in the suite

`ryandebraal.com` overflows horizontally by 118 px at 320 px wide and 48 px at 390 px (measured on the page as committed
*before* the asset migration, so it is not a regression). `common.spec.mjs` marks that one test with `test.fail(...)`: it
passes while the bug exists and **fails the day it is fixed** — remove the `test.fail` line then.

## The baseline ratchet (`baselines.json`)

Records every raster asset's pixel size, plus the SHA-256 of every JPEG. The tests then enforce: images never get smaller, JPEGs
never change bytes, and every image is recorded. After adding or *deliberately* replacing an image run
`npm run baseline:update` and commit `baselines.json` with the asset (and regenerate the manifest with
`tools\build-asset-manifest.ps1`). A tag is immutable, so a changed lossy file normally ships under a new name or a new tag.

## Adding things

* **An asset** — put it under `<domain>/<category>/` (or `fonts/`), kebab-case; `tools\build-asset-manifest.ps1`;
  `npm run baseline:update`; `npm run test:assets`.
* **A site** — add an entry to `SITES` in `lib/paths.mjs` (dir, live URL, allowed hosts, HTML budget, fonts used) and a
  `<site>.spec.mjs` for its specifics; `common.spec` picks it up automatically. Add its folder to `DOMAIN_ROOTS`.
* **A budget / allowed host** — edit `lib/budgets.mjs` / `lib/paths.mjs` and say why in the commit.

## CI

`ci.workflow.example.yml` is a ready-to-copy GitHub Actions workflow (kept here, **not** under `.github/`): it checks out the
four repos side by side, runs `assets` + `sites` in local mode on every push, and `test:live` + `test:cdn` on a schedule and
after a release. Local-mode runs need no network beyond installing npm packages.
